            <h2>Career of Gauranga Das</h2>
            <p>While doing his engineering graduation in IIT Bombay his attention was drawn towards Lord Krishna and he used to visit the ISKCON temple regularly. Then later he began to read Bhagavad Gita in his college days and he learns the life things like birth, death, and more about soulful life.

            His career turning point occurred when he was studying in his college. When one of his batchmates tried to attempt suicide for not getting a gold medal in academics rather than he bagged a silver medal. The boy hangs himself by a rope, but the rope broke and he was saved from committing the blunder. The reason for his suicide attempt is not getting a gold medal and he always scored a gold medal in all other exams. So that he could not able to handle his failure pressure. He also finds some of his friends roaming happily who have failed in 3 to 5 subjects. So he came to a conclusion that

            “Certainly, it is not an achievement that makes you happy or unhappy. It must be something more. “

            Then he came up with an equation of stress i.e. Stress = Expectation – Reality and Happiness = Attainment – Desire.

            Explanation: Indeed expectations are attached to those achievements that define whether a person is happy or not. This made him gather more knowledge about life and inspired him to join ISKCON.</p>
